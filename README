A rough-and-pseudoready spectrograph using OpenGLES.
Uses the microphone on iOS.


Outstanding issues:
- Visual artifact due to lazy math when computing width of display.
- Mac OSX project does not yet work; shaders are incorrect, and there are a couple of noted TODOs.

Missing features:
- Use noise estimate to adjust the floor for the signal display.
- Make SampleBuffer a proper ring buffer to permit longer FFTs and overlaps.
