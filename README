A rough-and-pseudoready spectrograph using OpenGLES.
Uses the microphone on iOS and Mac OS X.

On OS X, you can install Soundflower (https://github.com/Cycling74/Soundflower) to reroute audio
into the app. You can pick the input source in the spectrogram app using its Source menu.

Outstanding issues:
- Visual artifact due to lazy math when computing width of display.
- Needs refactor

Missing features:
- Use noise estimate to adjust the floor for the signal display.
- Make SampleBuffer a proper ring buffer to permit longer FFTs and overlaps.
- Pause
